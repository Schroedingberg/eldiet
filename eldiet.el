;; Author: Aaron Rebmann
;; Keywords: Nutrition, Org-mode, Diet
;; Homepage: https://github.com/Schroedingberg/eldiet
;;; Commentary: A nutrition planner for Emacs, built upon org mode.
;;; Plan so far: Use the capture functionality to capture a meal you eat.
;;; Then for example a fuzzy search in a database (or an org table, whatever I will come up with)
;;; could be executed...
;;; Org dashboard could be tweaked to show how much kcal are left...


;;; Code:
(require 'org)



(provide 'eldiet)
;;; eldiet.el ends here
