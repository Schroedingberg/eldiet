* Eldiet
A nutrition/diet planning tool for the Emacs geek who wants to stay/get in shape.








* Status
There is not much to see here at the moment. I just wanted to have an initial repository to be able to work on
this occasionally.

* Ideas

 - Calorie indicator in modeline (like 1454/2500)
 - Database and datastructure need to be figured out -- Maybe the database from [[http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/practical-a-simple-database.html][this]] lisp tutorial will help
 - Major mode, minor mode, write only window? All of them?
 - Use capture to note a meal
   - Can you run a function when doing a capture, allowing you to interactively
     pick the foods you use for that meal?
 - Integration with an orgmode based shopping list
 - Integration with an orgmode based cookbook
 - Babel based analytics (e.g. inline plots with R/Python or just ascii plots with elisp)
